                <hr>
                <p>Communication brings lovers together and makes it easy for them to build chemistry and love. The conversations you have with your significant other play a strong role in determining how happy, fun and strong your relationship will be.

</p>
               <h2>Topic 2</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> No matter how difficult some topics may seem sometimes, discussing them will help ease a lot of tension and leave room for your relationship to grow. You’ll also find that you both understand each other better.</p>
               <h2>Topic 3</h2>
                <hr>
                <p> It doesn’t matter whether you are in a new relationship or you’ve been married for years. These topics will not only help you get closer to your lover; it will also give you ideas on what to talk about when it feels like you are running out of topics. And you can always refine and repeat them as you and your partner will always have different answers each time they come up. This way, you’ll never run out of interesting conversations.</p>
